He is very proud of his back yard and once he gets to know \\na person, will invite them over to see his lawn and garden.  Taylor has lived in supported accommodation since he \\nwas 21 years old. Taylor likes to get to know people before they come to his home. Taylor likes spending time with \\nothers that can keep up with him and like spending time outside. Taylor enjoys having a big glass of cold water \\nwith ice after his outside activities.  Taylor lives with two other gentlemen who are significantly older than Taylor \\nand who prefer to be inside rather than outside. Taylor does not seem to think being inside is much fun.  Taylor’s \\nmother passed away when he was 21 and his father suffered a stroke shortly after the passing of his mother, at \\nwhich time Taylor entered supported accommodation. Taylor has two older brothers [Tim and Jason] who take \\nturns visiting Taylor once a month on a Saturday morning, sometimes taking Taylor [with staff support] to see his \\ndad who is in a nursing home approximately two hours’ drive away.  It is uncertain if Taylor understands what has \\nhappened to his parents, but he stopped signing for them after living in his home for a few months. Taylor looks \\nforward to seeing his brothers each month and will spend extra time in the back yard to make sure it is very tidy \\nfor their visit.  Taylor enjoys going out, some of his favourite places to visit is the local park which has a gym \\ncircuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and bushwalking tracks.    Taylor responds with \\nsupport from his staff to members of the community with gestures, facial expressions and signs such as “good”, \\n“ok”, “hello” and “bye”. Taylor has relaxed body language and posture when out with small groups.  Taylor is \\ngenerally healthy, only experiencing minor colds once or twice a year.  Taylor is not fussy when it comes to food \\nand enjoys eating the healthy foods that staff prepare for him. Taylor also drinks plenty of water which further \\nsupports his health. As Taylor is constantly on the go, he has sufficient exercise daily to support his health and \\nwellbeing. Taylor has damage to his frontal lobe that causes him to have short-term memory deficits. \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

If staff do not respond to Taylor hitting his head and \\nfull body slam into solid objects within 30 seconds and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor will \\nrun towards staff, eyes wide, hands fisted at sides, stiff body and will hit staff in the head or shoulder area with his \\nown head.

Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations may reduce the likelihood of his use of \\nbehaviour that causes harm to self or others: \\n• \\nFollowing negative interactions with co-tenants, staff are to ensure Taylor receives extra information \\n[speech and sign] and additional reminders about activities for the day [once de-escalated and open to \\ncommunication]. \\n• \\nStaff are to be well versed in Taylorʼs daily schedule and ensure they provide stability in line with this \\nschedule. \\no Staff are to confirm well in advance that Taylor is able to engage in his daily activities as listed on \\nhis daily schedule, if staff identify any potential changes they are to have alternatives available for \\nTaylor to choose from and communicate such to any staff coming on shift. \\n• \\nTaylor would benefit from further investigation and possible clinical review into causes for any sleep \\ndisturbances when presenting as tired for more than two days in a row. \\n• \\nInclude all staff considerations and preparation of other options as topics for discussion, information \\nsharing and updating at each staff meeting. To be signed off by the House Coordinator. \\n \\nIt has been identified that Taylor will engage in behaviour that causes harm to self or others if he is unsure what is \\nhappening next. Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations will reduce his need to use behaviour \\nthat causes harm to self or others. \\n• \\nTaylor benefits from clear, concise and frequent communication [speech and sign] on what is happening \\nnext: \\no Staff are to ensure that prior [5 minutes] to completing a current activity with Taylor, they let \\nTaylor know [speech and sign] what is happening next in his day. \\no Staff are to ensure that Taylor has opportunity to have some level of choice in relation to his next \\nactivity. \\no Staff are to continue to provide information to Taylor on what is happening next [speech and sign] \\nwhilst he transitions from one activity to another. \\n• \\nStaff are to use speech and sign with Taylor about his daily schedule throughout the day: \\no Upon waking, immediately after breakfast and morning tea, half hour before and after lunch and \\nafternoon tea, then hourly until dinner, half hour after dinner then hourly until Taylor chooses to \\nprepare for bed. \\nTeaching of the alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s) (e.g., description of the teaching \\nstrategy and materials needed) \\nStaff are to teach Taylor to use the sign for “next” when he is unsure of what is happening next. It is important that \\nstaff speak while they sign with Taylor, following his communication profile and “All About Me” book. Remember \\nto keep communication with Taylor short and clear, using speech whilst signing, maximum five word sentences. \\n',\n",

Taylor has used sign language in the \\npast, staff are to recommence using signs uniformly across all areas of Taylors life, speaking whilst signing. \\n \\nTaylor’s support staff will provide teaching sessions where Taylor is given the opportunity to learn and practice his \\nnew skill [using “next” sign] \\n• \\nAfter breakfast each day, staff are to discuss [speech and sign] the new skill with Taylor, reminding him \\nthey will practice during the day \\n• \\nStaff will also run through with Taylor what will be happening just prior to each teaching session, and \\ncheck that he is okay to begin each training session [speech and sign] \\n• \\nTeaching sessions are to take place after preferred activity, when Taylor is in a positive mood [smiling, \\nrelaxed posture, nil escalation for at least one hour before] \\n• \\nTeaching sessions are to take place at least three times a day for three minutes \\n• \\nThese sessions will begin on 15th May 2014 in Taylor’s home where he will be prompted [speech and sign] \\nto use his “next” sign at the end of each activity \\n• \\nTaylor’s progress will be recorded on the Task Record Sheet. \\nOther strategies (e.g., social, independence, coping, tolerance, etc.) \\nOther supports to improve Taylor’s quality of life include:  \\n1. Scheduling visits to Taylor’s brother’s houses and liaising with his brothers to organise times when they \\nwill come and visit him or take him out. \\n2. A personal shopping program which is teaching Taylor to purchase small items from the local store, \\nindependently. \\n3. Staff supporting Taylor to be involved with the local soccer club. \\n4. Visiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and \\nbushwalking tracks.  \\n5. Ensuring that Taylor has access to several of the following activities daily: Playing ball games, catch and \\nthrow with a large ball, running on sand or grass with bare feet, push-ups and sit-ups, climbing \\nropes/playground equipment, caring for the lawn and garden, taking out the rubbish and car washing. \\n \\nThe community access arrangements in place for the adult \\nVisiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the \\nbeach and bushwalking tracks.

If Taylor begins to engage in this behaviour immediately speak and sign to him what is \\nhappening next and encourage Taylor to use his ‘next’ sign. \\nStrategies to ensure the safety of the person and/or others \\nIf Taylor continues to escalate, ensure the safety of all by telling other people in the room to leave immediately, \\nkeeping Taylor in your line of sight, position your back to the door and continue to speak and sign what is \\nhappening next and that staff are there to help him. If Taylor begins to attempt to hit staff with his head, \\ncommence seclusion protocol. \\nPost-incident debriefing with the person with disability and/or parents, support staff, etc. \\nFollowing the use of behaviour that causes harm to self or others, Taylor is often disorientated and may not \\nremember why he is on the floor, against a wall or secluded.  It is very important that staff let Taylor know they \\nare there to help him. \\n• \\nAsk Taylor if he is okay using speech and sign. \\n• \\nOffer Taylor a drink of water. \\n \\nWhen Taylor is de-escalated [relaxed posture and body language], let him know that when he is unsure of what is \\nhappening next, he can use his “next” sign to let staff know he needs help and they can help him.

       "'Positive Behaviour Support Plan (PBSP)  Summary Document    We envision that the user interface will contain six separate pages. Below is a description of each page and the text  boxes we propose to be included.      PAGE 1 – About the Person with Disability    •  This page contains the relevant information about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP.  This information only needs to be entered once by the user.    NOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly  be looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided).    Provide a short summary about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP  Taylor is an energetic and outdoor loving 23 year old.  He is very proud of his back yard and once he gets to know  a person, will invite them over to see his lawn and garden.  Taylor has lived in supported accommodation since he  was 21 years old. Taylor likes to get to know people before they come to his home. Taylor likes spending time with  others that can keep up with him and like spending time outside. Taylor enjoys having a big glass of cold water  with ice after his outside activities.  Taylor lives with two other gentlemen who are significantly older than Taylor  and who prefer to be inside rather than outside. Taylor does not seem to think being inside is much fun.  Taylor’s  mother passed away when he was 21 and his father suffered a stroke shortly after the passing of his mother, at  which time Taylor entered supported accommodation. Taylor has two older brothers [Tim and Jason] who take  turns visiting Taylor once a month on a Saturday morning, sometimes taking Taylor [with staff support] to see his  dad who is in a nursing home approximately two hours’ drive away.  It is uncertain if Taylor understands what has  happened to his parents, but he stopped signing for them after living in his home for a few months. Taylor looks  forward to seeing his brothers each month and will spend extra time in the back yard to make sure it is very tidy  for their visit.  Taylor enjoys going out, some of his favourite places to visit is the local park which has a gym  circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and bushwalking tracks.    Taylor responds with  support from his staff to members of the community with gestures, facial expressions and signs such as “good”,  “ok”, “hello” and “bye”. Taylor has relaxed body language and posture when out with small groups.  Taylor is  generally healthy, only experiencing minor colds once or twice a year.  Taylor is not fussy when it comes to food  and enjoys eating the healthy foods that staff prepare for him. Taylor also drinks plenty of water which further  supports his health. As Taylor is constantly on the go, he has sufficient exercise daily to support his health and  wellbeing. Taylor has damage to his frontal lobe that causes him to have short-term memory deficits.        PAGE 2 – Assessments and Data Gathering    •  This page contains the relevant information regarding the assessments undertaken, and the data gathered to  inform PBSP development. This information only needs to be entered once by the user.    NOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly  be looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided).    Persons consulted to prepare this PBSP (add/remove rows as required)  Who are they?  How were they consulted?  Adult with disability  Direct observation  Family of adult  Interview – face to face  Guardian  Interview – face to face  Neuropsychiatrist  Interview – telephone  Speech and language pathologist  Interview – telephone  Graduate occupational therapist  Interview – telephone  General practitioner  Interview – telephone  Service manager  Interview – telephone  House coordinator  Interview – telephone  Direct support staff  Interview – telephone  Outline the behavioural assessment approaches implemented to develop this PBSP  A functional behaviour assessment that included the use of the Contextual Assessment Inventory, the Functional  Assessment Interview, scatterplots and ABC note cards, and semi-structured interviews.  Additional non-behavioural assessments undertaken or reviewed to inform the development of this PBSP  Comprehensive Health Assessment Program (CHAP) by GP, Communication assessment by speech and language  pathologist, mental health assessment by neuropsychiatrist, and occupational therapy assessment by  occupational therapist.          PAGE 3 – Functional Behavioural Assessment    •  We envision that this page will start with a drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five  functions of behaviour:  o Avoidance/escape  o Communication  o Physical/sensory need  o Access- person/object/activity  o Other – please specify    •  Once they choose a function, the text boxes below would come up for the user to input information.    •  Following this, the user will be asked if they want to include another function of behaviour.  o If YES, the drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five functions behaviour  appears again. Once a choice is made, these text boxes appear again.  ▪  Repeat this process until the user has no more functions to add.    NOTE: The items on the existing BSPA-tool will be used to assess the content in this section. We need to  make some additional modifications to the tool to assist in more precise scoring.    Function  Avoidance/escape  Communication  Physical/sensory  need  Access –  person/object/activity  Other – please  specify      Function – Name of function (either avoidance/escape, communication, physical/sensory need, seeking an  object/activity, other – please specify)    Description of behaviours (include frequency, duration and severity) that align with this function  Full body slam [running into walls and other solid objects, forcefully connecting with head, torso and limbs  together] and hitting head on solid objects [walls] and hitting staff with head [forward head-butt to staff head or  shoulder area]. Before these behaviours occur, deep, he will show low vocalisations [humming progresses to  grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth] and runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted at sides, stiff  body.  Setting events, triggers and consequences related to these behaviours (add/remove rows as necessary)  Setting events   Triggers  Consequences  When Taylor has had a negative  interaction with co-tenant/s earlier  in day  Unsure of what is happening next  Access to support staff  When Taylor has had schedule  changes earlier in day      When Taylor is tired      A summary statement outlining the functional hypothesis  Taylor will make a deep humming/grunting noise and pace when he is unsure of what is happening next.  Taylor  does this to access staff support [the provision of information].  If staff do not respond to Taylor’s deep  humming/grunting and pacing within two minutes and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor’s  behaviour that causes harm to self or others will escalate and he will run towards and full body slam the closest  large solid object and commence hitting head on that object.  If staff do not respond to Taylor hitting his head and  full body slam into solid objects within 30 seconds and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor will  run towards staff, eyes wide, hands fisted at sides, stiff body and will hit staff in the head or shoulder area with his  own head.  This behaviour is more likely to occur if Taylor has had negative interaction with his cotenant/s, and/or  there are changes to his schedule earlier in the day, and/or he is tired.  Proposed alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s)  Replace full body slam and hitting head behaviours with using a ‘next’ sign      Page 4 – Positive Behavioural Support Interventions    Goals    Goal(s) specific to the behaviours described  Goal By 15th August 2014 when Taylor is unsure of what is happening next; Taylor will use the sign for ‘next’.   Taylor will use this replacement behaviour instead of full body slams and hitting head on large solid objects and  staff. Taylor will use his new skill with 100% independence, on every occasion, when he wants to know what is  happening next.  Goals specific to enhancing the person’s quality of life   None required.      Strategies    Environmental changes to address setting events and triggers (changes to reduce and/or eliminate their influence)  Taylor is more likely to respond using behaviour that causes harm to self or others when he is unsure of what is  happening next, following negative interactions with co-tenant/s and or schedule changes earlier in the day and or  is tired. Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations may reduce the likelihood of his use of  behaviour that causes harm to self or others:  •  Following negative interactions with co-tenants, staff are to ensure Taylor receives extra information  [speech and sign] and additional reminders about activities for the day [once de-escalated and open to  communication].  •  Staff are to be well versed in Taylorʼs daily schedule and ensure they provide stability in line with this  schedule.  o Staff are to confirm well in advance that Taylor is able to engage in his daily activities as listed on  his daily schedule, if staff identify any potential changes they are to have alternatives available for  Taylor to choose from and communicate such to any staff coming on shift.  •  Taylor would benefit from further investigation and possible clinical review into causes for any sleep  disturbances when presenting as tired for more than two days in a row.  •  Include all staff considerations and preparation of other options as topics for discussion, information  sharing and updating at each staff meeting. To be signed off by the House Coordinator.    It has been identified that Taylor will engage in behaviour that causes harm to self or others if he is unsure what is  happening next. Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations will reduce his need to use behaviour  that causes harm to self or others.  •  Taylor benefits from clear, concise and frequent communication [speech and sign] on what is happening  next:  o Staff are to ensure that prior [5 minutes] to completing a current activity with Taylor, they let  Taylor know [speech and sign] what is happening next in his day.  o Staff are to ensure that Taylor has opportunity to have some level of choice in relation to his next  activity.  o Staff are to continue to provide information to Taylor on what is happening next [speech and sign]  whilst he transitions from one activity to another.  •  Staff are to use speech and sign with Taylor about his daily schedule throughout the day:  o Upon waking, immediately after breakfast and morning tea, half hour before and after lunch and  afternoon tea, then hourly until dinner, half hour after dinner then hourly until Taylor chooses to  prepare for bed.  Teaching of the alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s) (e.g., description of the teaching  strategy and materials needed)  Staff are to teach Taylor to use the sign for “next” when he is unsure of what is happening next. It is important that  staff speak while they sign with Taylor, following his communication profile and “All About Me” book. Remember  to keep communication with Taylor short and clear, using speech whilst signing, maximum five word sentences.  Taylor’s short-term memory is supported well by regular speech and sign.  Taylor has used sign language in the  past, staff are to recommence using signs uniformly across all areas of Taylors life, speaking whilst signing.    Taylor’s support staff will provide teaching sessions where Taylor is given the opportunity to learn and practice his  new skill [using “next” sign]  •  After breakfast each day, staff are to discuss [speech and sign] the new skill with Taylor, reminding him  they will practice during the day  •  Staff will also run through with Taylor what will be happening just prior to each teaching session, and  check that he is okay to begin each training session [speech and sign]  •  Teaching sessions are to take place after preferred activity, when Taylor is in a positive mood [smiling,  relaxed posture, nil escalation for at least one hour before]  •  Teaching sessions are to take place at least three times a day for three minutes  •  These sessions will begin on 15th May 2014 in Taylor’s home where he will be prompted [speech and sign]  to use his “next” sign at the end of each activity  •  Taylor’s progress will be recorded on the Task Record Sheet.  Other strategies (e.g., social, independence, coping, tolerance, etc.)  Other supports to improve Taylor’s quality of life include:   1. Scheduling visits to Taylor’s brother’s houses and liaising with his brothers to organise times when they  will come and visit him or take him out.  2. A personal shopping program which is teaching Taylor to purchase small items from the local store,  independently.  3. Staff supporting Taylor to be involved with the local soccer club.  4. Visiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and  bushwalking tracks.   5. Ensuring that Taylor has access to several of the following activities daily: Playing ball games, catch and  throw with a large ball, running on sand or grass with bare feet, push-ups and sit-ups, climbing  ropes/playground equipment, caring for the lawn and garden, taking out the rubbish and car washing.    The community access arrangements in place for the adult  Visiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the  beach and bushwalking tracks. Taylor is to attend at least one of these outings of his choice  every second day, for a minimum of two hours.    Taylor is supported by staff to attend to household tasks in the community such as going  shopping on a weekly basis.    Meeting new staff in a park or sports field. This occurs once per month on average, depending on  the staff turnover at Taylor’s home.      Reinforcement for Skill Development    Proposed reinforcers  Praise  Schedule of reinforcement  Every time Taylor uses the “next” sign, staff will immediately praise him for letting them know he needs help using  speech and sign, and wants to know what is happening next. Staff to then immediately provide information using  speech and sign - and wherever possible choices - on what is happening next to Taylor. Staff are to check if Taylor  understands, using speech and sign, what is happening next.  How were these reinforcers identified?  His parents, guardian and support staff indicated that praise works well with Taylor – he likes being told that he  has ‘done a good job’.      De-Escalation - Reactive strategies for challenging behaviours    How to prompt the alternative or functionally replacement behaviour(s)  When Taylor is unsure of what is happening next he may show signs that indicate he is about to engage in the  behaviour that causes harm to himself or others. These early behaviours are:  a. deep, low vocalisations [humming  progresses to grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth] b. runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted  at sides, stiff body.   If Taylor begins to engage in this behaviour immediately speak and sign to him what is  happening next and encourage Taylor to use his ‘next’ sign.  Strategies to ensure the safety of the person and/or others  If Taylor continues to escalate, ensure the safety of all by telling other people in the room to leave immediately,  keeping Taylor in your line of sight, position your back to the door and continue to speak and sign what is  happening next and that staff are there to help him. If Taylor begins to attempt to hit staff with his head,  commence seclusion protocol.  Post-incident debriefing with the person with disability and/or parents, support staff, etc.  Following the use of behaviour that causes harm to self or others, Taylor is often disorientated and may not  remember why he is on the floor, against a wall or secluded.  It is very important that staff let Taylor know they  are there to help him.  •  Ask Taylor if he is okay using speech and sign.  •  Offer Taylor a drink of water.    When Taylor is de-escalated [relaxed posture and body language], let him know that when he is unsure of what is  happening next, he can use his “next” sign to let staff know he needs help and they can help him.  Staff to model  using the “next” sign and invite Taylor to practice using his “next” sign with them.        PAGE 5 – Restrictive Intervention    •  We envision that this page will start with a YES/NO item that asks if restrictive interventions are proposed  for use.     •  Then, a drop-down menu will come up that allows the user to choose one of five restrictive intervention  options:  o Chemical restraint  o Physical restraint  o Mechanical restraint  o Environmental restraint  o Seclusion    •  Once they choose a restrictive intervention option, the appropriate set of text boxes (see below) would come  up for the user to input information.    •  Following this, the user will be asked if they want to include another restrictive intervention.  o If YES, the drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five restrictive intervention  options appears again. Once a choice is made, the appropriate set of text boxes appear again.  ▪  Repeat this process until the user has no more restrictive interventions to add.    NOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly  be looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided).    Are you proposed to use restrictive interventions?  Yes  No    Type of restrictive intervention    Restrictive intervention  Chemical  Physical  Mechanical  Environmental  Seclusion    Chemical Restraint    Medication(s) that will be used (e.g., name, dosage, frequency, administration, route, prescriber)  Name  Dosage  Frequency  Administration  Route  Prescriber  Risperidone  3mg morning  and evening  Routine  Tablet  Orally  Neuropsychiatrist  Positive behavioural support strategies to be used before the PRN use of the medication  Not required as this medication is to be used on a routine basis  Circumstance(s) in which the medication(s) will be used  Taylor is prescribed fixed dose Risperidone 6mg [3mg b.d.] by his Neuropsychiatrist Dr Kelp.  Taylor’s Risperidone  aids in reducing the intensity of serious incidents, whilst the proactive measures in this plan are being  implemented.      Procedure for administering the medication(s), including observation and monitoring of side-effects  The Risperidone is pre-packed by the pharmacist in a Webster Pack and is checked and signed for by staff when  collected.  The administration of Risperidone is immediately recorded on Taylor’s medication chart, signed by staff  member administering and countersigned by next staff member on shift [confirming medication has been  removed from the Webster Pack].    Any issues arising regarding side effects or missed medication will necessitate the following immediate actions:   •  Contact the General Practitioner; or Poisons Information Centre 13 11 26; then   •  Contact the House Coordinator or On-call Coordinator; then    •  Complete and fax an Error in Medication form to the Service Manager.    Taylor will be safeguarded from abuse, neglect and exploitation by accurate and efficient monitoring and  evaluation, followed by rigorous and timely information sharing and feedback.      Taylor’s medication will be monitored and evaluated as follows:   •  Daily monitoring by Support Staff; monthly monitoring by Dr Smythe; quarterly evaluation by Dr Kelp;  quarterly information provision to family [Tim and Jason], Service Manager and Dee Yarrs by the House  Coordinator.    Taylor is monitored closely for any side effects by his support staff and is provided with a nutritious and varied diet  and drinks plenty of water.  No other medications are introduced to Taylor without prior approval from his  Neuropsychiatrist Dr Kelp and General Practitioner Dr Smythe.    Taylor has monthly general health checks with his General Practitioner Dr Smythe as additional monitoring for side  effects.  How will chemical restraint be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person?  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign ‘next’) that  reduction in chemical restraint will be clinically indicated.  Why is the use of this medication the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others?  The routine use of Risperidone is being undertaken to reduce the intensity of Taylor’s incidents of behaviour that  causes harm to self or others, during the implementation of the behavioural strategies listed in this plan.  By  reducing the intensity of Taylor’s behaviour it also aids in avoiding the use of highly intrusive forms of restriction  such as physical restraint. In combination with the strategies outlined in this plan, the use of chemical restraint  Risperidone is the least restrictive alternative to support Taylor.  Social validity of the restrictive practice  How did you assess the acceptability of this practice?  Who did you consult with to assess this?

As such, there are no positive strategies which precede  each episode of him placing it on each morning.  Circumstance(s) in which the restraint will be used  Consistent with the recommendation of Dr Kelp, Neuropsychiatrist, Taylor is to wear his protective headgear  during waking hours  Procedure for using the restraint, including observation, monitoring and maximum time period  He will wear the headgear for 18 hours continuous with removal for showering and retiring to bed.    Upon rising, Taylor is to be invited to assist staff to put his headgear on, staff are to ensure it is securely fitted with  no hair caught in the back laces and both chin straps secured without pinching any skin.  Upon retiring or having a  shower, staff are to invite Taylor to help them take his headgear off.     Following hitting head behaviour, when safe to do so and Taylor is happy for you to approach, staff to inspect  Taylor’s headgear to ensure it is securely fitted and not pulling any hair or pinching any skin.     Taylor’s protective headgear is to be cleaned with sanitising wipes and inspected nightly after Taylor goes to bed  for any signs of wear and tear to the padding, internal and external soft surfaces, back laces and double chin strap.   Any identified concerns are to be recorded on Taylor’s headgear maintenance form and the House Coordinator or  On-call Coordinator to be contacted immediately.    Taylor will be safeguarded from abuse, neglect and exploitation by accurate and efficient monitoring and  evaluation, followed by rigorous and timely information sharing and feedback.  Taylor’s Restrictive Practices will  be monitored and evaluated as follows:  •  Reported per incident, daily monitoring by Support Staff; monthly monitoring by the House Coordinator;  monthly information provision to family [Tim and Jason], the Service Manager and the Behaviour Support  Specialist by the House Coordinator, annual reviews by his Neuropsychiatrist.  How do you know this restraint is safe to use?  A safety assessment was undertaken by Taylor’s occupational therapist, who confirmed that the headgear was  safe to use for 18 hours continuous wear.  How will the restraint be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person?  The continued use and need for the mechanical restraint will be impacted directly by the strategies listed in this  plan.  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign ‘next’)  there will be a reduction in his head hitting behaviours and that the use of the mechanical restraint can be  reviewed for reduction in use.  Why is the use of this practice the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others?  Taylors’ hitting head behaviour to solid objects and or staff is of such intensity that he has suffered diffuse  Traumatic Brain Injury [TBI] with ongoing contusions, hematomas, lacerations and nerve damage resulting in  communication and cognitive impairment.    Due to the significant frequency, intensity and duration of Taylors  behaviour that causes harm to self or others, and following professional advice from Dr Kelp, Neuropsychiatrist,  Taylor wears protective headgear during waking hours.  This is an interim measure which is vital to keep Taylor  safe and reduce possible injury whilst he learns the replacement behaviour.  Social validity of the practice  How did you assess the acceptability of this practice?  Who did you consult with to assess this?

Authorisation for the use of the practices  Authorising body  Approval period          Seclusion    Frequency of use  Routine use  As needed  Positive behavioural support strategies to be used before the as needed use of seclusion  The continued use and need for the use of seclusion will be impacted directly by the application of strategies listed  in this plan.  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign  ‘next’) that reduction in seclusion will be clinically indicated.    In the interim;   1. When Taylor is unsure of what is happening next he may show signs that indicate that he is about to  engage in the behaviours that cause harm to himself or others.  These early behaviours are;    a. Deep, low vocalisations [humming progresses to grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth];   b. Runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted at sides, stiff body;      If Taylor begins to engage in this behaviour immediately use speech and sign to him what is happening next and  encourage Taylor to use his “next” sign;      2. If Taylor’s behaviour escalates and he begins to use the behaviours that cause harm to self or others (Full  body slam and hitting head on staff)   o Ensure the safety of Taylor by using speech and signing what is happening next and that staff are  there to help him, whilst moving any items on the floor out of Taylor’s direct path;   o If Taylor continues to escalate, ensure the safety of all by telling other people in the room to leave  immediately, keeping Taylor in your line of sight, position your back to the door and continue to  use speech and sign what is happening next and that staff are there to help him;  Circumstance(s) in which seclusion will be used  Seclusion is only to be used when the safety of staff or others is at risk due to Taylor attempting to hit them with  his head.   1. Taylor is only to be secluded within his own residential property, by removing all other persons from his  space and restricting his free exit from the rear section of the building or  2. Preventing access to staff, co-tenants and others locked in the staff room. A demonstration of why use of  seclusion is the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety  The maximum frequency of seclusion per day, week and/or month; and for how long (minutes/hours)  Taylor usually settles within 10 minutes of any incident of behaviour that causes harm to self or others.  Seclusion  may be used for a maximum of 15 minutes at the discretion of support staff.   Seclusion will not occur more than  twice per day, or 60 times per month.  Procedure for using seclusion, including observation and monitoring  1. Redirect Taylor to the rear of the building;   a. Lock the hallway door maintaining Taylor’s access to the toilet and bathroom, but limiting access  to the front of the house  b. Taylor is to be the only person in the rear of the building;   2. If unable to redirect Taylor to the rear of the property: a. all staff, co-tenants and others in the home are  to proceed directly to the staff room and lock the door;   3. Staff are to ensure they remain in the closest position possible to the locked door, either the hall door or  the staffroom door, and listening for cessation of banging sounds.   4. After nil banging sounds can be heard by staff for a period of 60 seconds:   a. Staff to speak to Taylor through the locked door, asking if he is OK;   b. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound, staff are to ask Taylor “can I come in”;   c. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound staff to unlock and slowly open the door, identifying  where Taylor is in the room;   d. Staff are to stand close to the door way with a relaxed posture and body language and provide  verbal support to Taylor, asking again if he is OK and if he would like a drink of water;   e. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound, a nod or sign for “good” staff to let Taylor know they  will get him a glass of water and do so;   f. When staff return to Taylor, they are to let Taylor know that everything is OK, that they are there  to help him;   g. When Taylor is exhibiting nil precursor or behaviour that causes harm to self or others, has a  relaxed posture and body language offer to help Taylor. Check his headgear to make sure it is  securely fitted and not pinching any skin or pulling any hair.    Reporting:    •  Each use of seclusion is reported as soon as practical [verbally within 3 hours, formally within 24 hours] to  the House Coordinator or On-call Coordinator.   •  Record all use of seclusion on Taylor’s Restrictive Practice Reporting Form; and   •  Complete a Behaviour Incident Report Form.    Taylor will be safeguarded from abuse, neglect and exploitation by accurate and efficient monitoring and  evaluation, followed by rigorous and timely information sharing and feedback.  The use of seclusion will be  monitored and evaluated as follows:   •  • Reported per use by Support Staff; weekly monitoring and monthly evaluation by the House  Coordinator; monthly information provision to family [Tim and Jason], his Neuropsychiatrist, the Service  Manager and the Behaviour Support Specialist by the House Coordinator.  How will seclusion be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person?  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign ‘next’) that  reduction in seclusion will be clinically indicated.  Why is the use seclusion the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others?  The episodic use of seclusion will be used to reduce harm to staff from Taylor.  The ongoing use of seclusion will  not improve Taylor’s quality of life or assist in the reduction of the overall impact of his behaviour that causes  harm to self or others.  However, its episodic use is necessary to prevent harm to staff while they implement the  strategies in this plan and Taylor is learning the skill of signing “next” to ask staff what is happening next.  The use  of seclusion is the least restrictive alternative for Taylor at present whilst he learns his replacement behaviour.

       "'Positive Behaviour Support Plan (PBSP) \\nSummary Document \\n \\nWe envision that the user interface will contain six separate pages. Below is a description of each page and the text \\nboxes we propose to be included. \\n \\n \\nPAGE 1 – About the Person with Disability \\n \\n• \\nThis page contains the relevant information about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP. \\nThis information only needs to be entered once by the user. \\n \\nNOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly \\nbe looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided). \\n \\nProvide a short summary about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP \\nTaylor is an energetic and outdoor loving 23 year old.  He is very proud of his back yard and once he gets to know \\na person, will invite them over to see his lawn and garden.  Taylor has lived in supported accommodation since he \\nwas 21 years old. Taylor likes to get to know people before they come to his home. Taylor likes spending time with \\nothers that can keep up with him and like spending time outside. Taylor enjoys having a big glass of cold water \\nwith ice after his outside activities.  Taylor lives with two other gentlemen who are significantly older than Taylor \\nand who prefer to be inside rather than outside. Taylor does not seem to think being inside is much fun.  Taylor’s \\nmother passed away when he was 21 and his father suffered a stroke shortly after the passing of his mother, at \\nwhich time Taylor entered supported accommodation. Taylor has two older brothers [Tim and Jason] who take \\nturns visiting Taylor once a month on a Saturday morning, sometimes taking Taylor [with staff support] to see his \\ndad who is in a nursing home approximately two hours’ drive away.  It is uncertain if Taylor understands what has \\nhappened to his parents, but he stopped signing for them after living in his home for a few months. Taylor looks \\nforward to seeing his brothers each month and will spend extra time in the back yard to make sure it is very tidy \\nfor their visit.  Taylor enjoys going out, some of his favourite places to visit is the local park which has a gym \\ncircuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and bushwalking tracks.    Taylor responds with \\nsupport from his staff to members of the community with gestures, facial expressions and signs such as “good”, \\n“ok”, “hello” and “bye”. Taylor has relaxed body language and posture when out with small groups.  Taylor is \\ngenerally healthy, only experiencing minor colds once or twice a year.  Taylor is not fussy when it comes to food \\nand enjoys eating the healthy foods that staff prepare for him. Taylor also drinks plenty of water which further \\nsupports his health. As Taylor is constantly on the go, he has sufficient exercise daily to support his health and \\nwellbeing. Taylor has damage to his frontal lobe that causes him to have short-term memory deficits. \\n \\n \\n \\nPAGE 2 – Assessments and Data Gathering \\n \\n• \\nThis page contains the relevant information regarding the assessments undertaken, and the data gathered to \\ninform PBSP development. This information only needs to be entered once by the user. \\n \\nNOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly \\nbe looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided). \\n \\nPersons consulted to prepare this PBSP (add/remove rows as required) \\nWho are they? \\nHow were they consulted? \\nAdult with disability \\nDirect observation \\nFamily of adult \\nInterview – face to face \\nGuardian \\nInterview – face to face \\nNeuropsychiatrist \\nInterview – telephone \\nSpeech and language pathologist \\nInterview – telephone \\nGraduate occupational therapist \\nInterview – telephone \\nGeneral practitioner \\nInterview – telephone \\nService manager \\nInterview – telephone \\nHouse coordinator \\nInterview – telephone \\nDirect support staff \\nInterview – telephone \\nOutline the behavioural assessment approaches implemented to develop this PBSP \\nA functional behaviour assessment that included the use of the Contextual Assessment Inventory, the Functional \\nAssessment Interview, scatterplots and ABC note cards, and semi-structured interviews. \\nAdditional non-behavioural assessments undertaken or reviewed to inform the development of this PBSP \\nComprehensive Health Assessment Program (CHAP) by GP, Communication assessment by speech and language \\npathologist, mental health assessment by neuropsychiatrist, and occupational therapy assessment by \\noccupational therapist. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPAGE 3 – Functional Behavioural Assessment \\n \\n• \\nWe envision that this page will start with a drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five \\nfunctions of behaviour: \\no Avoidance/escape \\no Communication \\no Physical/sensory need \\no Access- person/object/activity \\no Other – please specify \\n \\n• \\nOnce they choose a function, the text boxes below would come up for the user to input information. \\n \\n• \\nFollowing this, the user will be asked if they want to include another function of behaviour. \\no If YES, the drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five functions behaviour \\nappears again. Once a choice is made, these text boxes appear again. \\n▪ \\nRepeat this process until the user has no more functions to add. \\n \\nNOTE: The items on the existing BSPA-tool will be used to assess the content in this section. We need to \\nmake some additional modifications to the tool to assist in more precise scoring. \\n \\nFunction \\nAvoidance/escape \\nCommunication \\nPhysical/sensory \\nneed \\nAccess – \\nperson/object/activity \\nOther – please \\nspecify \\n \\n \\nFunction – Name of function (either avoidance/escape, communication, physical/sensory need, seeking an \\nobject/activity, other – please specify) \\n \\nDescription of behaviours (include frequency, duration and severity) that align with this function \\nFull body slam [running into walls and other solid objects, forcefully connecting with head, torso and limbs \\ntogether] and hitting head on solid objects [walls] and hitting staff with head [forward head-butt to staff head or \\nshoulder area]. Before these behaviours occur, deep, he will show low vocalisations [humming progresses to \\ngrunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth] and runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted at sides, stiff \\nbody. \\nSetting events, triggers and consequences related to these behaviours (add/remove rows as necessary) \\nSetting events  \\nTriggers \\nConsequences \\nWhen Taylor has had a negative \\ninteraction with co-tenant/s earlier \\nin day \\nUnsure of what is happening next \\nAccess to support staff \\nWhen Taylor has had schedule \\nchanges earlier in day \\n \\n \\nWhen Taylor is tired \\n \\n \\nA summary statement outlining the functional hypothesis \\nTaylor will make a deep humming/grunting noise and pace when he is unsure of what is happening next.  Taylor \\ndoes this to access staff support [the provision of information].  If staff do not respond to Taylor’s deep \\nhumming/grunting and pacing within two minutes and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor’s \\nbehaviour that causes harm to self or others will escalate and he will run towards and full body slam the closest \\nlarge solid object and commence hitting head on that object.  If staff do not respond to Taylor hitting his head and \\nfull body slam into solid objects within 30 seconds and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor will \\nrun towards staff, eyes wide, hands fisted at sides, stiff body and will hit staff in the head or shoulder area with his \\nown head.  This behaviour is more likely to occur if Taylor has had negative interaction with his cotenant/s, and/or \\nthere are changes to his schedule earlier in the day, and/or he is tired. \\nProposed alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s) \\nReplace full body slam and hitting head behaviours with using a ‘next’ sign \\n \\n \\nPage 4 – Positive Behavioural Support Interventions \\n \\nGoals \\n \\nGoal(s) specific to the behaviours described \\nGoal By 15th August 2014 when Taylor is unsure of what is happening next; Taylor will use the sign for ‘next’.  \\nTaylor will use this replacement behaviour instead of full body slams and hitting head on large solid objects and \\nstaff. Taylor will use his new skill with 100% independence, on every occasion, when he wants to know what is \\nhappening next. \\nGoals specific to enhancing the person’s quality of life  \\nNone required. \\n \\n \\nStrategies \\n \\nEnvironmental changes to address setting events and triggers (changes to reduce and/or eliminate their influence) \\nTaylor is more likely to respond using behaviour that causes harm to self or others when he is unsure of what is \\nhappening next, following negative interactions with co-tenant/s and or schedule changes earlier in the day and or \\nis tired. Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations may reduce the likelihood of his use of \\nbehaviour that causes harm to self or others: \\n• \\nFollowing negative interactions with co-tenants, staff are to ensure Taylor receives extra information \\n[speech and sign] and additional reminders about activities for the day [once de-escalated and open to \\ncommunication]. \\n• \\nStaff are to be well versed in Taylorʼs daily schedule and ensure they provide stability in line with this \\nschedule. \\no Staff are to confirm well in advance that Taylor is able to engage in his daily activities as listed on \\nhis daily schedule, if staff identify any potential changes they are to have alternatives available for \\nTaylor to choose from and communicate such to any staff coming on shift. \\n• \\nTaylor would benefit from further investigation and possible clinical review into causes for any sleep \\ndisturbances when presenting as tired for more than two days in a row. \\n• \\nInclude all staff considerations and preparation of other options as topics for discussion, information \\nsharing and updating at each staff meeting. To be signed off by the House Coordinator. \\n \\nIt has been identified that Taylor will engage in behaviour that causes harm to self or others if he is unsure what is \\nhappening next. Strategies that proactively support Taylor in these situations will reduce his need to use behaviour \\nthat causes harm to self or others. \\n• \\nTaylor benefits from clear, concise and frequent communication [speech and sign] on what is happening \\nnext: \\no Staff are to ensure that prior [5 minutes] to completing a current activity with Taylor, they let \\nTaylor know [speech and sign] what is happening next in his day. \\no Staff are to ensure that Taylor has opportunity to have some level of choice in relation to his next \\nactivity. \\no Staff are to continue to provide information to Taylor on what is happening next [speech and sign] \\nwhilst he transitions from one activity to another. \\n• \\nStaff are to use speech and sign with Taylor about his daily schedule throughout the day: \\no Upon waking, immediately after breakfast and morning tea, half hour before and after lunch and \\nafternoon tea, then hourly until dinner, half hour after dinner then hourly until Taylor chooses to \\nprepare for bed. \\nTeaching of the alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s) (e.g., description of the teaching \\nstrategy and materials needed) \\nStaff are to teach Taylor to use the sign for “next” when he is unsure of what is happening next. It is important that \\nstaff speak while they sign with Taylor, following his communication profile and “All About Me” book. Remember \\nto keep communication with Taylor short and clear, using speech whilst signing, maximum five word sentences. \\nTaylor’s short-term memory is supported well by regular speech and sign.  Taylor has used sign language in the \\npast, staff are to recommence using signs uniformly across all areas of Taylors life, speaking whilst signing. \\n \\nTaylor’s support staff will provide teaching sessions where Taylor is given the opportunity to learn and practice his \\nnew skill [using “next” sign] \\n• \\nAfter breakfast each day, staff are to discuss [speech and sign] the new skill with Taylor, reminding him \\nthey will practice during the day \\n• \\nStaff will also run through with Taylor what will be happening just prior to each teaching session, and \\ncheck that he is okay to begin each training session [speech and sign] \\n• \\nTeaching sessions are to take place after preferred activity, when Taylor is in a positive mood [smiling, \\nrelaxed posture, nil escalation for at least one hour before] \\n• \\nTeaching sessions are to take place at least three times a day for three minutes \\n• \\nThese sessions will begin on 15th May 2014 in Taylor’s home where he will be prompted [speech and sign] \\nto use his “next” sign at the end of each activity \\n• \\nTaylor’s progress will be recorded on the Task Record Sheet. \\nOther strategies (e.g., social, independence, coping, tolerance, etc.) \\nOther supports to improve Taylor’s quality of life include:  \\n1. Scheduling visits to Taylor’s brother’s houses and liaising with his brothers to organise times when they \\nwill come and visit him or take him out. \\n2. A personal shopping program which is teaching Taylor to purchase small items from the local store, \\nindependently. \\n3. Staff supporting Taylor to be involved with the local soccer club. \\n4. Visiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and \\nbushwalking tracks.  \\n5. Ensuring that Taylor has access to several of the following activities daily: Playing ball games, catch and \\nthrow with a large ball, running on sand or grass with bare feet, push-ups and sit-ups, climbing \\nropes/playground equipment, caring for the lawn and garden, taking out the rubbish and car washing. \\n \\nThe community access arrangements in place for the adult \\nVisiting the local park which has a gym circuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the \\nbeach and bushwalking tracks. Taylor is to attend at least one of these outings of his choice \\nevery second day, for a minimum of two hours. \\n \\nTaylor is supported by staff to attend to household tasks in the community such as going \\nshopping on a weekly basis. \\n \\nMeeting new staff in a park or sports field. This occurs once per month on average, depending on \\nthe staff turnover at Taylor’s home. \\n \\n \\nReinforcement for Skill Development \\n \\nProposed reinforcers \\nPraise \\nSchedule of reinforcement \\nEvery time Taylor uses the “next” sign, staff will immediately praise him for letting them know he needs help using \\nspeech and sign, and wants to know what is happening next. Staff to then immediately provide information using \\nspeech and sign - and wherever possible choices - on what is happening next to Taylor. Staff are to check if Taylor \\nunderstands, using speech and sign, what is happening next. \\nHow were these reinforcers identified? \\nHis parents, guardian and support staff indicated that praise works well with Taylor – he likes being told that he \\nhas ‘done a good job’. \\n \\n \\nDe-Escalation - Reactive strategies for challenging behaviours \\n \\nHow to prompt the alternative or functionally replacement behaviour(s) \\nWhen Taylor is unsure of what is happening next he may show signs that indicate he is about to engage in the \\nbehaviour that causes harm to himself or others. These early behaviours are:  a. deep, low vocalisations [humming \\nprogresses to grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth] b. runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted \\nat sides, stiff body.   If Taylor begins to engage in this behaviour immediately speak and sign to him what is \\nhappening next and encourage Taylor to use his ‘next’ sign. \\nStrategies to ensure the safety of the person and/or others \\nIf Taylor continues to escalate, ensure the safety of all by telling other people in the room to leave immediately, \\nkeeping Taylor in your line of sight, position your back to the door and continue to speak and sign what is \\nhappening next and that staff are there to help him. If Taylor begins to attempt to hit staff with his head, \\ncommence seclusion protocol. \\nPost-incident debriefing with the person with disability and/or parents, support staff, etc. \\nFollowing the use of behaviour that causes harm to self or others, Taylor is often disorientated and may not \\nremember why he is on the floor, against a wall or secluded.  It is very important that staff let Taylor know they \\nare there to help him. \\n• \\nAsk Taylor if he is okay using speech and sign. \\n• \\nOffer Taylor a drink of water. \\n \\nWhen Taylor is de-escalated [relaxed posture and body language], let him know that when he is unsure of what is \\nhappening next, he can use his “next” sign to let staff know he needs help and they can help him.

As such, there are no positive strategies which precede \\neach episode of him placing it on each morning. \\nCircumstance(s) in which the restraint will be used \\nConsistent with the recommendation of Dr Kelp, Neuropsychiatrist, Taylor is to wear his protective headgear \\nduring waking hours \\nProcedure for using the restraint, including observation, monitoring and maximum time period \\nHe will wear the headgear for 18 hours continuous with removal for showering and retiring to bed. \\n \\nUpon rising, Taylor is to be invited to assist staff to put his headgear on, staff are to ensure it is securely fitted with \\nno hair caught in the back laces and both chin straps secured without pinching any skin.  Upon retiring or having a \\nshower, staff are to invite Taylor to help them take his headgear off.  \\n \\nFollowing hitting head behaviour, when safe to do so and Taylor is happy for you to approach, staff to inspect \\nTaylor’s headgear to ensure it is securely fitted and not pulling any hair or pinching any skin.  \\n \\nTaylor’s protective headgear is to be cleaned with sanitising wipes and inspected nightly after Taylor goes to bed \\nfor any signs of wear and tear to the padding, internal and external soft surfaces, back laces and double chin strap.  \\nAny identified concerns are to be recorded on Taylor’s headgear maintenance form and the House Coordinator or \\nOn-call Coordinator to be contacted immediately. \\n \\nTaylor will be safeguarded from abuse, neglect and exploitation by accurate and efficient monitoring and \\nevaluation, followed by rigorous and timely information sharing and feedback.  Taylor’s Restrictive Practices will \\nbe monitored and evaluated as follows: \\n• \\nReported per incident, daily monitoring by Support Staff; monthly monitoring by the House Coordinator; \\nmonthly information provision to family [Tim and Jason], the Service Manager and the Behaviour Support \\nSpecialist by the House Coordinator, annual reviews by his Neuropsychiatrist. \\nHow do you know this restraint is safe to use? \\nA safety assessment was undertaken by Taylor’s occupational therapist, who confirmed that the headgear was \\nsafe to use for 18 hours continuous wear. \\nHow will the restraint be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person? \\nThe continued use and need for the mechanical restraint will be impacted directly by the strategies listed in this \\nplan.  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign ‘next’) \\nthere will be a reduction in his head hitting behaviours and that the use of the mechanical restraint can be \\nreviewed for reduction in use. \\nWhy is the use of this practice the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others? \\nTaylors’ hitting head behaviour to solid objects and or staff is of such intensity that he has suffered diffuse \\nTraumatic Brain Injury [TBI] with ongoing contusions, hematomas, lacerations and nerve damage resulting in \\ncommunication and cognitive impairment.    Due to the significant frequency, intensity and duration of Taylors \\nbehaviour that causes harm to self or others, and following professional advice from Dr Kelp, Neuropsychiatrist, \\nTaylor wears protective headgear during waking hours.  This is an interim measure which is vital to keep Taylor \\nsafe and reduce possible injury whilst he learns the replacement behaviour. \\nSocial validity of the practice \\nHow did you assess the acceptability of this practice? \\nWho did you consult with to assess this? \\nGoing through the plan with relevant stakeholders, \\nallowing them to ask questions and taking into account \\nall feedback provided in the final version of this plan. \\nParents, guardians and support staff \\nAuthorisation for the use of restrictive practices \\nAuthorising body \\nApproval period \\nAuthorised Program Officer, MV Services \\n12 months from June 1, 2022 \\n \\n \\nEnvironmental \\n \\nDescription of the restraint(s) to be used \\n \\nFrequency of use \\nRoutine use \\nAs needed \\nPositive behavioural support strategies to be used before the as needed use of the restraint \\n \\nCircumstance(s) in which the restraint will be used \\n \\nWhat is the person with disability prevented from accessing? \\n \\nProcedure for using the restraint, including observation and monitoring  \\n \\nWill other people be impacted by the use of this restraint? \\nYes \\nNo \\nIf YES, how will impact on others be minimised? \\n \\nHow will the restraint be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person? \\n \\nWhy is the use of this practice the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others? \\n \\nSocial validity of the practice \\nHow did you assess the acceptability of this practice? \\nWho did you consult with to assess this? \\n \\n \\nAuthorisation for the use of the practices \\nAuthorising body \\nApproval period \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSeclusion \\n \\nFrequency of use \\nRoutine use \\nAs needed \\nPositive behavioural support strategies to be used before the as needed use of seclusion \\nThe continued use and need for the use of seclusion will be impacted directly by the application of strategies listed \\nin this plan.  It is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign \\n‘next’) that reduction in seclusion will be clinically indicated.   \\nIn the interim;  \\n1. When Taylor is unsure of what is happening next he may show signs that indicate that he is about to \\nengage in the behaviours that cause harm to himself or others.  These early behaviours are;   \\na. Deep, low vocalisations [humming progresses to grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth];  \\nb. Runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted at sides, stiff body;   \\n \\nIf Taylor begins to engage in this behaviour immediately use speech and sign to him what is happening next and \\nencourage Taylor to use his “next” sign;   \\n \\n2. If Taylor’s behaviour escalates and he begins to use the behaviours that cause harm to self or others (Full \\nbody slam and hitting head on staff)  \\no Ensure the safety of Taylor by using speech and signing what is happening next and that staff are \\nthere to help him, whilst moving any items on the floor out of Taylor’s direct path;  \\no If Taylor continues to escalate, ensure the safety of all by telling other people in the room to leave \\nimmediately, keeping Taylor in your line of sight, position your back to the door and continue to \\nuse speech and sign what is happening next and that staff are there to help him; \\nCircumstance(s) in which seclusion will be used \\nSeclusion is only to be used when the safety of staff or others is at risk due to Taylor attempting to hit them with \\nhis head.  \\n1. Taylor is only to be secluded within his own residential property, by removing all other persons from his \\nspace and restricting his free exit from the rear section of the building or \\n2. Preventing access to staff, co-tenants and others locked in the staff room. A demonstration of why use of \\nseclusion is the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety \\nThe maximum frequency of seclusion per day, week and/or month; and for how long (minutes/hours) \\nTaylor usually settles within 10 minutes of any incident of behaviour that causes harm to self or others.  Seclusion \\nmay be used for a maximum of 15 minutes at the discretion of support staff.   Seclusion will not occur more than \\ntwice per day, or 60 times per month. \\nProcedure for using seclusion, including observation and monitoring \\n1. Redirect Taylor to the rear of the building;  \\na. Lock the hallway door maintaining Taylor’s access to the toilet and bathroom, but limiting access \\nto the front of the house  b. Taylor is to be the only person in the rear of the building;  \\n2. If unable to redirect Taylor to the rear of the property: a. all staff, co-tenants and others in the home are \\nto proceed directly to the staff room and lock the door;  \\n3. Staff are to ensure they remain in the closest position possible to the locked door, either the hall door or \\nthe staffroom door, and listening for cessation of banging sounds.  \\n4. After nil banging sounds can be heard by staff for a period of 60 seconds:  \\na. Staff to speak to Taylor through the locked door, asking if he is OK;  \\nb. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound, staff are to ask Taylor “can I come in”;  \\nc. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound staff to unlock and slowly open the door, identifying \\nwhere Taylor is in the room;  \\nd. Staff are to stand close to the door way with a relaxed posture and body language and provide \\nverbal support to Taylor, asking again if he is OK and if he would like a drink of water;  \\ne. When Taylor responds with his “yes” sound, a nod or sign for “good” staff to let Taylor know they \\nwill get him a glass of water and do so;  \\nf. When staff return to Taylor, they are to let Taylor know that everything is OK, that they are there \\nto help him;  \\ng. When Taylor is exhibiting nil precursor or behaviour that causes harm to self or others, has a \\nrelaxed posture and body language offer to help Taylor. Check his headgear to make sure it is \\nsecurely fitted and not pinching any skin or pulling any hair.   \\nReporting:   \\n• \\nEach use of seclusion is reported as soon as practical [verbally within 3 hours, formally within 24 hours] to \\nthe House Coordinator or On-call Coordinator.  \\n• \\nRecord all use of seclusion on Taylor’s Restrictive Practice Reporting Form; and  \\n• \\nComplete a Behaviour Incident Report Form. \\n \\nTaylor will be safeguarded from abuse, neglect and exploitation by accurate and efficient monitoring and \\nevaluation, followed by rigorous and timely information sharing and feedback.  The use of seclusion will be \\nmonitored and evaluated as follows:  \\n• \\n• Reported per use by Support Staff; weekly monitoring and monthly evaluation by the House \\nCoordinator; monthly information provision to family [Tim and Jason], his Neuropsychiatrist, the Service \\nManager and the Behaviour Support Specialist by the House Coordinator. \\nHow will seclusion be gradually reduced as behavioural goals are achieved by the person? \\nIt is anticipated that once Taylor is able to independently use the replacement behaviour (ie sign ‘next’) that \\nreduction in seclusion will be clinically indicated. \\nWhy is the use seclusion the least restrictive way of ensuring the safety of the person and/or others? \\nThe episodic use of seclusion will be used to reduce harm to staff from Taylor.  The ongoing use of seclusion will \\nnot improve Taylor’s quality of life or assist in the reduction of the overall impact of his behaviour that causes \\nharm to self or others.  However, its episodic use is necessary to prevent harm to staff while they implement the \\nstrategies in this plan and Taylor is learning the skill of signing “next” to ask staff what is happening next.

Taylor has lived in supported accommodation since he \\nwas 21 years old. Taylor likes to get to know people before they come to his home. Taylor likes spending time with \\nothers that can keep up with him and like spending time outside. Taylor enjoys having a big glass of cold water \\nwith ice after his outside activities.  Taylor lives with two other gentlemen who are significantly older than Taylor \\nand who prefer to be inside rather than outside. Taylor does not seem to think being inside is much fun.  Taylor’s \\nmother passed away when he was 21 and his father suffered a stroke shortly after the passing of his mother, at \\nwhich time Taylor entered supported accommodation. Taylor has two older brothers [Tim and Jason] who take \\nturns visiting Taylor once a month on a Saturday morning, sometimes taking Taylor [with staff support] to see his \\ndad who is in a nursing home approximately two hours’ drive away.  It is uncertain if Taylor understands what has \\nhappened to his parents, but he stopped signing for them after living in his home for a few months. Taylor looks \\nforward to seeing his brothers each month and will spend extra time in the back yard to make sure it is very tidy \\nfor their visit.  Taylor enjoys going out, some of his favourite places to visit is the local park which has a gym \\ncircuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and bushwalking tracks.    Taylor responds with \\nsupport from his staff to members of the community with gestures, facial expressions and signs such as “good”, \\n“ok”, “hello” and “bye”. Taylor has relaxed body language and posture when out with small groups.  Taylor is \\ngenerally healthy, only experiencing minor colds once or twice a year.  Taylor is not fussy when it comes to food \\nand enjoys eating the healthy foods that staff prepare for him. Taylor also drinks plenty of water which further \\nsupports his health. As Taylor is constantly on the go, he has sufficient exercise daily to support his health and \\nwellbeing. Taylor has damage to his frontal lobe that causes him to have short-term memory deficits.'],\n",

       "'Positive Behaviour Support Plan (PBSP) \\nSummary Document \\n \\nWe envision that the user interface will contain six separate pages. Below is a description of each page and the text \\nboxes we propose to be included. \\n \\n \\nPAGE 1 – About the Person with Disability \\n \\n• \\nThis page contains the relevant information about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP. \\nThis information only needs to be entered once by the user. \\n \\nNOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly \\nbe looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided). \\n \\nProvide a short summary about the person with disability who is the focus of the PBSP \\nEddie is 15 years old and lives at home with his parents.  Eddie’s brother Jack and sister Jill live locally however do \\nnot visit often due to Eddie’s challenging behaviours.  Eddie has a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability and \\ninsulin dependent type 1 diabetes. \\n \\nEddie enjoys spending time with other males his age who include him in their activities and most of all being active.  \\nEddie is a very fast runner and loves to race others across any open spaces he finds himself in.  Due to Eddie’s fitness, \\nheight and long legs, he outruns most people.  Eddie will often laugh loudly whilst he is running.   \\n \\nEddie’s favourite things are spending time with his dad, running, wide open spaces, playing basketball and watching \\naeroplanes.  Upon hearing an aeroplane, Eddie will run from wherever he is to get a look at the aeroplane and will \\nlaugh loudly whilst looking up and waving at them.  Eddie goes to basketball training Tuesday and Thursday \\nafternoon, playing games with other teams most Saturdays. \\n \\nAt home Eddie requires prompting to attend to his personal hygiene needs and to assist daily activities.  Eddie \\nresponds well to being shown what to do then staying with him for support whilst he tries to imitate them.   \\n \\nEddie enjoys being outside in his back yard, in the sunshine, and often runs around without any real direction with \\na big smile on his face.   \\n \\nEddie is a good sleeper, putting himself to bed before 9.00 pm, waking between 6.00 and 7.00 in the morning each \\nday.  Eddie will generally always sleep through any disturbances during the night, however, if woken, it can take \\nsome time to encourage Eddie back to bed, rather than getting up to start his day.  If it is still dark outside this is \\neasier to do. \\n \\nEddie’s family report that Eddie shows signs of unease, such as tightened jaw, upper body and limbs, when in a \\nvehicle.  They also report that it is difficult to get Eddie into and out of any vehicle. \\n \\nEddie enjoys his food however does not appear to understand why he can’t eat the same food as others.  Family \\nand staff report behaviours of concern to be a regular occurrence at meal times both within the home and at school.  \\nEddie also does not like to have his insulin injection each day and family are always prepared for behaviours of \\nconcern such as hitting people at injection time which is generally at 8.00 am (following the advice of Eddie’s \\nspecialist).  A nutritionist has provided a detailed menu plan which family and school staff follow diligently.  Eddie \\ndoes not like to go and see the nutritionist and often family send her reports of how Eddie is going rather than \\ntaking him to see her. \\n \\nEddie attends St Lucia State High School and is in year 10.  Due to his learning needs he receives assistance from a \\nteacher’s aide in the classroom. The teacher provides differentiated curriculum and instruction as required due to \\nthe impact of his intellectual impairment on his learning.  When Eddie is supported he works well on academic tasks \\nand demonstrates a willingness to try hard. \\nPAGE 2 – Assessments and Data Gathering \\n \\n• \\nThis page contains the relevant information regarding the assessments undertaken, and the data gathered to \\ninform PBSP development. This information only needs to be entered once by the user. \\n \\nNOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section. This section will mainly \\nbe looking for the absence of content (i.e., information is not provided). \\n \\nPersons consulted to prepare this PBSP (add/remove rows as required) \\nWho are they? \\nHow were they consulted? \\nMother \\nFace to face interview \\nFather \\nTelephone interview \\nTeacher \\nFace to face interview \\nIntegration aide \\nVideo conference interview \\nSports coordinator \\nFace to face interview \\nOutline the behavioural assessment approaches implemented to develop this PBSP \\nContextual Assessment Inventory completed by his teacher, observation (scatter plots) completed by his teacher \\nand integration aide, and Functional Assessment Interview (completed by his mother and teacher) \\nAdditional non-behavioural assessments undertaken or reviewed to inform the development of this PBSP \\nNone \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPAGE 3 – Functional Behavioural Assessment \\n \\n• \\nWe envision that this page will start with a drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five \\nfunctions of behaviour: \\no Avoidance/escape \\no Communication \\no Physical/sensory need \\no Seeking an object/activity \\no Other – please specify \\n \\n• \\nOnce they choose a function, the text boxes below would come up for the user to input information. \\n \\n• \\nFollowing this, the user will be asked if they want to include another function of behaviour. \\no If YES, the drop-down menu that allows the user to choose one of the five functions behaviour \\nappears again. Once a choice is made, these text boxes appear again. \\n▪ \\nRepeat this process until the user has no more functions to add. \\n \\nNOTE: The items on the existing BSPA-tool will be used to assess the content in this section. We need to \\nmake some additional modifications to the tool to assist in more precise scoring. \\n \\nFunction \\nAvoidance/escape \\nCommunication \\nPhysical/sensory \\nneed \\nSeeking an \\nobject/activity \\nOther – please \\nspecify \\n \\n \\nFunction – Name of function (either avoidance/escape, communication, physical/sensory need, seeking an \\nobject/activity, other – please specify) \\n \\nDescription of behaviours (include frequency, duration and severity) that align with this function \\nEddie hits staff and other students with his open hand or pushes them forcefully, daily, on average 2.5 incidents \\nper day. Incidents last on average 10 minutes and Minor injuries to others as a result of being slapped or pushed. \\nEddie rips up books and other teaching materials or throws objects around the room. This happens less than once \\na day, with an average of one or two incidents every couple of days. Incidents last on average 10 minutes and \\nthere is damage to classroom materials and/or students are injured if hit by flying objects. \\nSetting events, triggers and consequences related to these behaviours (add/remove rows as necessary) \\nSetting events  \\nTriggers \\nConsequences \\nNo breakfast \\nAsked to complete work in class \\nTeacher goes to Eddie to calm him \\ndown. He is often removed from the \\nclassroom. \\nNormal school routine has had a \\nchange \\n \\nGains teacher attention and escapes \\nLow blood sugar levels \\n \\n \\nA summary statement outlining the functional hypothesis \\nWhen Eddie is asked to complete work in class that he finds difficult or needs to complete independently he uses \\nphysical aggression or property damage, resulting in the teacher attending to him and him not completing the \\nrequired work. The physical aggression and property damage have the same functions, to gain the attention of the \\nteacher and to avoid work that he finds difficult or is not his preference. \\nProposed alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s) \\nAsk teacher for help \\n \\n \\nPage 4 – Positive Behavioural Support Interventions \\n \\nGoals \\n \\nGoal(s) specific to the behaviours described \\nEddie will ask the teacher or the Aide for help by putting his hand up every time he needs help or a break. He will \\nachieve this by the end of June, 2021. \\nGoals specific to enhancing the person’s quality of life  \\nNone specified \\n \\n \\nStrategies \\n \\nEnvironmental changes to address setting events and triggers (changes to reduce and/or eliminate their influence) \\nTo manage the triggers of Eddie’s behaviour: \\n \\n• \\nWherever possible, teach concepts using examples and activities that interest Eddie \\n• \\nSet teaching activities in smaller, time limited “chunks”, no longer than 10 minutes each time. \\n• \\n Do assignments in small groups where possible, with students Eddie gets on well with. \\n• \\nRemind Eddie of the planned routine for doing classwork before each break so that when he returns to \\nclass he understands what happens next. \\n• \\nClosely supervise Eddie to identify quickly when he needs assistance or is drifting off task. When he is \\nlooking as though he is struggling or becoming distracted the teacher will move to him and ask him to \\nshow his work or whether he needs assistance. The teacher will provide him with assistance or \\nencouragement, according to his progress. \\n• \\nRecognise that it is likely that Eddie gets tired and has difficulty concentrating in the late afternoon so \\nmake sure that the work he is given is interesting for him and not too challenging. \\n \\nTo assist, school management will:  \\n \\n• \\nContinue to supply a teacher aide that will enable Eddie to be given targeted instruction and support at \\ntimes when he needs to engage in academic work that he finds difficult and to support the development \\nof his social and communication skills. \\n• \\nAllocate relief teachers known to Eddie whenever possible to reduce the effects of change in teachers \\nwhen the regular teacher is not available. \\n• \\nCommunicate regularly with Eddie’s parents to inform them of changes to the school routine or other \\nmatters that need to be reinforced with Eddie to assist in his understanding. \\n• \\nProvide coordination of Eddie’s involvement in school activities outside the classroom with other school \\npersonnel, including the Sports Coordinator to ensure that he is able to participate. \\n \\nTo assist, teachers will: \\n \\n• \\nEnsure that Eddie’s blood sugar level is tested at the specified times each day and that he eats the food he \\nhas brought with him. \\n• \\nDevelop lesson plans to differentiate the instruction suited to Eddie’s learning needs and ensure that the \\nteacher’s aide and other teachers are familiar with these lesson plans. \\n• \\nProvide teaching that suits Eddie’s learning needs. \\n• \\nUtilise a visual timetable for all students on the whiteboard each day. \\n• \\nDevelop and use social stories to assist Eddie in understanding daily routines, changes in routine and social \\ninteractions. \\n• \\nArrange the classroom to minimise noise and distractions for Eddie, particularly when he is working. \\n• \\nAdvise and support the teacher aide before each lesson in the work/activities to be completed by Eddie \\nand the supports that need to be provided to him. \\n• \\nTeam Eddie up with students he gets along well with. \\nEddie enjoys running and other active sports.  This is an important opportunity for Eddie to increase his \\nparticipation in school activities. Strategies include; \\n• \\nSign Eddie up for the school basketball team and cross country running teams. \\n• \\nEddie’s father has offered to volunteer for school sports carnivals. Ensure that Mr Yahoo is invited along so \\nthat he can coordinate Eddie and a couple of other students to assist in the organising of the events, such \\nas getting equipment ready, scoring etc. \\n• \\nDuring other sports activities in which he is not participating, Eddie will be asked by the coordinating \\nteacher to assist in the scoring. \\n \\nEddie will also be supported to take an active role in non-sporting activities at the school, such as; \\n• \\nAssisting the teacher in organising the school assembly. \\n• \\nAssisting with food preparation at the breakfast club. \\n• \\nEnrolling him in the Buddy reading program. \\n \\nEddie will be supported to attend the “Best Mates” social club one lunchtime per week. This is a play and activities \\nbased program with the aim of developing student interactions and social skills. Eddie’s friends will also be \\nencouraged to attend the sessions he attends. \\n \\n \\nReinforcement for Skill Development \\n \\nProposed reinforcers \\nAttention, praise and tokens \\nSchedule of reinforcement \\n• \\nAlways provide Eddie with attention when he begins to attempt the work and makes effort.  Gradually \\nwithdraw this attention as he attends to his work for longer periods of time. \\n• \\nProvide praise for completed assignments. \\n• \\nProvide praise when he asks for help or requests a break (the desired behaviour). \\n• \\nWhen Eddie has completed work in the classroom (with and without assistance) he will be provided with a \\ntoken to put on the chart on display on the classroom wall. At the end of the day when he has collected at \\nleast 5 tokens he will able to spend the last ½ hour of the school day engaging in an activity of his choice \\nand interest. Eddie likes to play games on the iPad so this would be his preferred activity. \\nHow were these reinforcers identified? \\nA preference assessment was undertaken by the behaviour support practitioner to ascertain what Eddie’s \\npreferred activities are. \\n \\n \\nDe-Escalation - Reactive strategies for challenging behaviours \\n \\nHow to prompt the alternative or functionally replacement behaviour(s) \\nIf Eddie begins to demonstrate the precursor behaviours to him hitting or engaging in property damage (getting \\nout of his chair, pacing, refusing to make eye contact) go over to him, get his attention and ask him if he would like \\nsome help. If Eddie nods his head sit down at the table with him and provide him with the assistance he needs. Do \\nnot delay in providing the assistance.  When he has sat down and when it is appropriate to do so, remind Eddie of \\nthe ways that he can ask for help from the teacher of the Aide.  When he completes the work support him to \\nengage in a preferred activity before moving on to the next activity. \\nStrategies to ensure the safety of the person and/or others \\nIf Eddie escalates and begins to engage in property damage such as throwing objects and ripping worksheets move \\naway from Eddie. Do not use threatening postures, a loud voice, or tell Eddie to calm down. Maintain the \\nappearance of being calm. If you can, distract Eddie by asking whether he would like to go outside and play \\nbasketball.

Once a choice is made, the appropriate set of text boxes appear again. \\n▪ \\nRepeat this process until the user has no more restrictive interventions to add. \\n \\nNOTE: We will need to develop checklist items to assess the content in this section.
